Annual Project Review Process
=============================

Please reference this walk through for the Annual Review Process. This will describe the process to review and update your projects.

Once a year, we require our users to review and, if necessary, update all projects within M-RETS. This guide will walk you through the renewal process.

After logging in to the M-RETS, you should see the following on your dashboard.

-   Click on 'Review Projects'. You will be brought to the Projects tab 'Awaiting Review'. From here, you should see the list of all projects that require review.

-   I reviewed all data for Second Solar and can confidently say nothing has changed in the last 365 days. Since all my data is correct, I am going to approve it. Click 'Projects' on the left side of the screen.

#### By accepting, User represents and warrants to M-RETS that all information for this Project shall be true, complete, and correct to the best of its knowledge, information and belief.

Repeat this process for all listed Projects.
