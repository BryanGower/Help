Participating is Programs
-------------------------

-   To participate in a Program, you must first create a ***new*** retirement account. Click on 'Accounts' on the left.

-   Click on 'Add New Account'

![](https://github.com/mrets/photos/blob/master/program_participating_programs9.png?raw=true)

-   After you change 'Account Type' to Retirement, you will see options to add the account to one of your programs. Be sure the Program you would like to join is checked.
