# Email Notifications

E-mail notifications are set to "No" by default. This default setting is to prevent unwanted email notifications. Therefore, each user must turn on email notifications by accessing the M-RETS platform.Â 

## 1. Click on Organization Info in the drop down in the upper right corner:
