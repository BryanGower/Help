How to Make an Hourly Claim
===========================

M-RETS developed a process to provide for the first hourly REC retirement in a production registry and we are excited to share this with our users. This guide will walk you through the process. The hourly retirement process embeds the hourly production data into the retirement claims process. This exciting achievement does more than just integrate hourly data into the claim. The process verifies that REC batches retired for hourly claims are whole and not split post issuance. The process allows for multiple batches to be retired at once and provides aggregate hourly data by hour, day, and month for the batches subject to the transaction.

**M-RETS allows Hourly Claims only for intact (i.e. not subdivided after issuance) batches of Certificates. The following will render a batch of certificates ineligible for an hourly claim at this time:**

**1. Certificates that an Organization has separated into multiple active batches for any reason, even if they maintain ownership of all the RECs from the original issuance.**

**2. Certificates in a batch where RECs from the issuance batch were transferred to another party.**

**3. Certificates where any of the RECs from the batch as issued were retired.**

**In other words, Organizations may not make an Hourly Claim in the situation that separate batches of active Certificates include the entirety of the original Issuance. This may change as the market develops, and M-RETS will keep our users updated. If you have questions about whether your Certificates qualify for Hourly Claims, please contact <systemadmin@mrets.org>.**

### 5.  Select the Certificates you would like to use for your hourly claim. Then, click the "Retire" button in the upper-right corner of your table.

<br>

### 8.  Enter the rest of your retirement details and click "Review Retirement".
<br>
  
### 9.  You may view and download your hourly generation by clicking “Hourly Claim Data”. Here are a few important things to know:

**1.The system defaults to Coordinated Universal Time. If you would like to view in a different time zone you need to select that. **

**2.MISO provides all hourly data to M-RETS based on the Eastern Time Zone, even if the generator is physically located in a different time zone. **

**3.If you are retiring multiple batches of Certificates, the data points shown is aggregated (i.e., the sum of each hour) for all the generators. **

**4. If you retire certificates over multiple months to see the data per hour per month you will need to use the download feature.**

<br>
</br>
  
### 11.  Once you have selected the relevant time zone, click the downward arrow icon to download a .CSV copyof your data. Your downloaded data will match the previously selected time zone. Based on the location of the Generator, you may see data outside of your selected vintage which will appear as a dash ( - ). Timesthat fall within the time zone of the generator but where there is no generation will be shown with a zero (0).

### 12.  If everything looks correct, click "Complete Retirement".

<br>
</br>
  
### 13.  Your retirement was successful! You may download your hourly retirement data on this page. The downloadable file is a PDF and is defaulted to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Similar to step 9: If you are retiring multiple batches of Certificates, the data points shown is aggeregated (i.e. the sum of each hour).
