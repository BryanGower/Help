How to Make an Hourly Claim
===========================

M-RETS is proud to be the first tracking system to provide the option to make Hourly Claims. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of making an hourly claim.

**M-RETS allows Hourly Claims for, and only for, intact (i.e. not subdivided after issuance) batches of Certificates. This excludes partially retired/transferred Certificates. This also excludes Certificates that an Organization has separated into multiple active batches. In other words, Organizations may not make an Hourly Claim in the situation that separate batches of active Certificates include the entirety of the original Issuance. If you have questions about whether your Certificates qualify for Hourly Claims, please contact <systemadmin@mrets.org>.**

### 1.  Click on your Certificates Tab.

### 6.  You will now see a new feature in the retirement process. Click on "Hourly Claim?". If this button is not clickable, your selected Certificates are not eligible for an Hourly Claim.
