Exporting Certificates
==============

This guide will walk you through the process to Export Certificates

M-RETS supports exporting Certificates to Compatible Tracking Systems (CTS). Currently approved Compatible Tracking Systems for exporting are:

-   Michigan Renewable Energy Certification System (MIRECS)
-   North American Renewables Registry (NAR)
-   North Carolina Renewable Energy Tracking System (NC-RETS)

***Exports from M-RETS to other registries carry a $0.01/REC fee.***\
To begin the Export process, select your Certificates that you wish to Export and click 'Transfer'.
