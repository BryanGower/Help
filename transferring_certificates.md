Transferring Certificates
=========================

How to Transfer a Certificate

M-RETS users may transfer active Certificates to:
-------------------------------------------------

1.  Another organization
2.  Other active account(s)
3.  To a compatible tracking system

Â How Do I Transfer Certificates?
--------------------------------

-   Select the batch(es) of Certificates you wish to transfer from the Active tab in the RECs section, then select "Transfer". For this example, I have selected two vintages totaling 7,200 Certificates.

-   Select where you would like to transfer these Certificates. For this example, I chose "Another Wind Account".

BUT WAIT!

What if I want to transfer a portion of a vintage? Simply click on the button labelled "View or Edit Details".

-   I agreed to transfer 50% of my vintages, so I will divide my vintage totals in half. After doing so, you can see my Total Active RECs has been reduced to 3,600.
