Feasibility Failures
====================

What to do if you get a feasibility analysis failure upon upload

The process for handling feasibility failures for the time being will be as follows:

1.  If you are uploading for multiple generators, please remove the generator with the failure notice and upload the file again so that your other generation is not delayed. 
2.  Contact <systemadmin@mrets.org> and please include the following:

(a) any necessary supporting documentation (e.g. meter read file or screenshot), and\
(b) a csv file with the specific generator upload information that failed the feasibility analysis. 

Once the M-RETS System Administrator reviews and confirms your data we we will process the upload and notify you.
