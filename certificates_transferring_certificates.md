# Transferring Certificates

How to Transfer a Certificate

## M-RETS users may transfer active Certificates to:

1.  Another organization
2.  Other active account(s)
3.  To a compatible tracking system

<br>

## How Do I Transfer Certificates?

-   Select the batch(es) of Certificates you wish to transfer from the Active tab in the RECs section, then select "Transfer". For this example, I have selected two vintages totaling 5,175 Certificates.

## BUT WAIT!

What if I want to transfer a portion of a vintage? Simply click in the fields under "Quantity (RECs)"

<br>

-   I agreed to transfer 50% of my vintages, so I will divide my vintage totals in half. After doing so, you can see my Total Active RECs has been reduced to 2,587.

-   Review your selections for accuracy, then select "Complete Transfer".
