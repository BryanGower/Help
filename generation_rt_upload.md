# Uploading Thermal Generation

Any user with Generation Submittal permissions can submit Dth data into M-RETS. Each time M-RETS receives generation data for a generator, the date and quantity of Dths are posted to the Generation Log. Any
fractional remainders will not issue certificates but will roll over to the next month of generation. Once uploaded, data will be labeled with one of the following:

<ul>
  <li>Accepted: Applies to all generation less than 1 Dth reported to M-RETS. The system will add this data to the subsequent month of generation for issuance.</li>
  <li>Issued: Applies to all generation 1 Dth or greater and indicates the Certificates are now active.</li>
  <li>Pending: Generation that fails feasibility and therefore needs M-RETS approval; or generation waiting to receive a ‘Feedstock’ allocation from a multi-feedstock generator. Pending Generation is not issued and therefore not represented by Active certificates.</ul>
  </ul>

## Uploading Generation

Users may upload all their generation for the whole month or in partial months as long as a whole month is uploaded. During the upload process, users must provide the Generator, vintage, Dth, and a complete allocation of Dth generated. During the upload, Users must declare whether the generation is 100% from renewable sources, or if the Generator used non-renewable sources. 

### Navigate to the Generation tab and select the "Add New Entry" button.

Certificates created by Generators that Self-report (i.e. Generators that do not use an IRE) must also submit with the generation information an invoice, receipt, or other official documents that identify the Dth of gas injected.1
