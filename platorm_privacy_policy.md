Information We Collect
We collect information about you so we can continue to provide and improve our Services to you and other users of the Site. The information collected may include items such as your name, e-mail address, address, phone number, facsimile number, credit card information, financial institution and bank account information, business size, industry type, information that you input into the M-RETS System, as well as other information that may or may not specifically identify you. The information collected on the Site may be stored at servers, computers, or other media located in or outside the United States.

Third-Party Sources
We may obtain personal and non-personal information about you from third-party sources. This information may be utilized, analyzed, and/or compared with information that we have collected from you or that you have submitted to the Site. To the extent M-RETS obtains information from third-party sources, M-RETS takes reasonable measures to ensure the third-parties lawfully obtained and provided the information to us. To the extent the third-parties unlawfully obtained and/or provided the information to us despite our reasonable measures to ensure the third-parties complied with all legal requirements in obtaining and providing the information to us, you understand, agree, and acknowledge that your sole legal remedy is against the third-party that engaged in the unlawful activity and that you will not assert any cause of action, claim or demand against M-RETS.

Information Collection Technology (Web Beacons and Cookies)
We may use various technologies to collect information from your computer about your activities on our Site. We may collect and store non-personally identifying information through cookies, log files, clear gifs (commonly known as "web beacons"), and third-parties to profile user activity and preferences. Technical and specification information about your browser and computer is automatically collected when you use or visit the Site. This information may include your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your browser type, operating system, access time(s), the content of previously accepted “cookies” from us, and the website address that referred you to our Site.

A cookie is data stored on your computer that tracks non-personal information about you. When using our Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies that enable us to improve the quality of our Service and to personalize your experience. Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on our Site, such as the content you access while on our Site, the links you click, and other activity you conduct while using our Site. You may choose to modify your web browser’s setting to disable cookies or limit their use. If you choose to disable or limit cookies, you are still able to access our Site, but you may be unable to use all of the features on our Site.

Our Site may contain web beacons (also known as "clear gifs") or similar technologies that gather non-personally identifiable information about your use of our Site. Such technology may also be contained in e-mail messages or newsletters from us that allow us to determine whether messages have been accessed. The purpose of our use of this technology is so that we may analyze the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, the quality of our Site, and the Services we provide.

Personal Information About Users Under 18 Years of Age Not Collected
The Site is meant for adults and those who have reached the age of majority as defined by the laws of their domicile. The Site is not meant for individuals under the age of 18 or those defined by the laws of their domicile as minors. Nonetheless, this Privacy Policy is still designed to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) to the extent COPPA applies to M-RETS. Accordingly, M-RETS does not knowingly collect or retain any personal information about users under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we collected or retained personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be promptly deleted from our database, servers, and all other media. Since we do not collect information from users under 13 years old, no such information is disclosed to third-parties.

Information Others May Collect
To enhance security and promote operational efficiency, the Site utilizes the resources of reputable hosting facilities that are controlled by third-parties. M-RETS is unable to provide any guarantees or warranties about these third-parties’ retention or usage of your information. If you have further questions or concerns about this issue, please contact M-RETS customer service.

Information Use and Sharing
We may use and share your information for any legally permissible purpose. We may match, use, and share any of the information we collect from you to any personally identifiable information we obtain through third-parties. Examples of some ways we may use or share information that we collect about you include:

providing you with products or services, whether from us, or any affiliates or sponsors;
providing you with customized content, advertising, and services;
providing technical or customer support;
performing research and analysis to gauge the use of or interest in the products, services, or content offered on our Site, and to develop new services;
communicating with you by e-mail, United States mail, telephone, text message, and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, any affiliates, sponsors or other third-parties;
enforcing our terms and conditions, or otherwise managing our business; and
performing functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
In order to perform certain Services on your behalf, we may publish certain information that you provide. For example, you agree that M-RETS shall have the right to publish your business and first name (last name omitted) as a subscriber of M-RETS. Similarly, you agree that any testimonial feedback or other comments provided by you to M-RETS become the sole and exclusive property of M-RETS and that such information may be used by M-RETS for any legally permissible purpose, including but not limited to marketing and advertising its services and products.

You acknowledge and agree that M-RETS may use and disclose your personal and non-personal information to public or private third-parties: (i) for inspection by law enforcement officials (including in the case of potential criminal activity); (ii) to respond to cease and desist letters, arbitration proceedings, legal actions and suits, criminal and civil subpoenas, any court orders; (iii) to enforce or apply the terms of this Privacy Policy or any other agreement between us, including the Terms of Use; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, or safety of M-RETS, our users, or others, whether during or after the term of your use of our Services.

Unless you opt out of certain communication features, we may use your information to communicate with you, such as through e-mail, newsletters, and telephone. You may opt out and/or unsubscribe to unsolicited marketing communications from M-RETS at any time. See the Opt-Out Provisions section below for applicable contact information and directions.

Your Information Will Not Be Sold
We will not sell any information you submit to us to any other third-party without prior written notice to you and an opportunity to opt-out.

Legal Process and Investigation Issues
From time to time, M-RETS may be required to respond to a subpoena or similar investigative demand from law enforcement, a court order, a government agency, or a private litigant. M-RETS reserves all rights to defend, within its sole discretion, against such legal requests, demands, and claims. For instance, M-RETS may raise or waive legal objections or rights. M-RETS also reserves the right to disclose your information when we believe it is reasonably appropriate based on the situation. Such disclosure may occur, but is not limited to, disclosing your information in connection with efforts to: investigate, prevent, or commence other actions regarding suspected illegal activity or other wrongdoing; to protect; defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or enforce our Site Terms of Service or other agreements or policies.

Notice about Social Security Numbers
M-RETS does not collect social security numbers of users. To the extent M-RETS comes into possession of users’ social security numbers or collects such information in the future, the information will be treated confidentially and not shared with third-parties unless allowed by law. Additionally, M-RETS will take reasonable steps to limit the access to the social security numbers and take legally required steps of securing the transmission of the data.

Links
The Site contains various links to other websites, including through advertisements. M-RETS disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices of third-parties that may have links to or from our website, or any framed content on our website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies/statements of every website that you visit that collects personally identifiable information.

Opt-Out Provisions and Updating Your Information
We value our user’s privacy and provide them with the option to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Site or use of our Site. The opt-out option is available at the time you sign up for your account. If you wish to change your opt-out preference or update your information after you initially sign up for your account, you can opt-out by any of the following means:

    (1) Send a written request to: M-RETS, at the address listed at the end of this Privacy Policy; or by

    (2) E-mail systemadmin@mrets.org

Your request will generally be responded to within 48 hours if your inquiry is via e-mail, or thirty (30) days if your inquiry is via United States mail.

Please note that changing your opt-out preference will only affect future activities or communications from us. In other words, if we already provided your information to a third-party before you changed your opt-out preferences, you will need to contact the third-party

directly. To opt-out of communications from our third-party business partners, if any, please contact them directly.

Information Retention and Security
M-RETS may store your information for more than one (1) year from the time of initial submission, as well as automated personal information we collect about you. However, if we obtain or collect your social security number or credit card number, that information will only be stored for a limited time pursuant to your authorization unless the law requires otherwise.

M-RETS takes reasonable security measures to protect users' information against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information, and the usage of reputable third-party vendors. Despite these reasonable measures, we cannot guarantee our security measures are impenetrable. Therefore, although we take reasonable steps to secure your information, we cannot and do not promise or warrant that your information will always remain secure.

Visitors Outside the United States
This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our Site from residents of the United States. The laws in other countries may or may not be as comprehensive as those in the United States. If you are a resident of another country or are visiting our Site from outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our Site, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third-parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are unwilling to accept these terms, then you agree that you will not use or access the Site or its Services.

Privacy Policy Updates and Revisions

If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will also post notice of the changes on our Site and/or may notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account. Your continued use of our Site or Services after we have posted any Privacy Policy changes indicates your agreement to the changes unless you notify us otherwise.

Terms of Privacy Policy Survive
To the extent any terms of this Privacy Policy are held invalid and/or unenforceable by a court of law or a competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Privacy Policy shall remain in full force and effect.

Limitations
M-RETS is not a financial institution or other entity required by law to adopt or publish this or any other Privacy Policy. The adoption or publication of this Privacy Policy does not subject M-RETS to any stricter duty in its collection, handling, storage and disclosure of nonpublic information than otherwise applies to M-RETS under applicable law. No person or entity shall have any right or recourse against M-RETS, its affiliates, agents, sponsors, or other related parties based on any alleged violation or noncompliance with this Privacy Policy by M-RETS.
