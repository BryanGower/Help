# Hourly Reporting

M-RETS is the first tracking system to support hourly data with issuances. Until now, you could only view hourly data on individual batches of Certificates. M-RETS now supports Hourly Reporting for multiple vintages. This guide will walk you through the Hourly Reporting process. 

Showcase how hourly data can be used to meet yout "24x7" renewable energy goal. This means you are not just meeting yout annual load with renewables, but you match your load 24 hours a day with renewable generation produced during the same hour.

This consists of:
* New hourly data reporting
* New hourly data retirement process

M-RETS allows Hourly Claims for, and only for, intact (i.e. not subdivided after issuance) batches of Certificates. This excludes partially retired/transferred Certificates. This also excludes Certificates that an Organization has separated into multiple active batches.
