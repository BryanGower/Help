Upload Renewable Thermal Generation Data
======================

**To encourage timely reporting, M-RETS enabled automatic validations to generation uploads. For small generators (1 to 150 kW), users have up to one year from the generation end date to upload generation. For large generators (>150 kW), users have 62 days from the generation end date to upload generation. M-RETS must approve any generation outside of these ranges.**

1.  Navigate to the Generation tab and select the "Add New Entry" button.
