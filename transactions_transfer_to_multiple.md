<br>

### Click the drop-down under "Select the account you would like these RECs to be transferred to."

Select your accounts. For this example, I am splitting the Certificates between three Accounts.

<br>

### Enter an percentage allotment for each selected Account. The percentages must total 100%. For this example, I am splitting this batch evenly with a 1 Certificate remainder.

<br>

**Please enter amounts carefully**. Certificates can only be split in whole numbers. Remainder certificates are allocated to the first account listed. To change which accounts get priority drag and drop the account rows.Â 

<br>

### You can cre-order the list of Accounts if you need to change the placement of remainder Certificates.

In this example, I chose a different batch of Certificates to show a remainder.
